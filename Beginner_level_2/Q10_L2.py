10. We are making n stone piles! The first pile has n stones. If n is
even, then all piles have an even number of stones. If n is odd, all
piles have an odd number of stones. Each pile must have more
stones than the previous pile but as few as possible. Write a
Python program to find the number of stones in each pile.
Sample Input: n = 7
Sample Output: Stones in a single pile = [2, 4, 6]
